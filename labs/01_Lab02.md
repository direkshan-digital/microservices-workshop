# Day 1 - Lab 2 : Deploy the solution to Azure Kubernetes Service

Workshop Template

## Exercise 1: Deploy the solution to Azure Kubernetes Service

**Duration**: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will connect to the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster you created before the hands-on lab and deploy the Docker application to the cluster using Kubernetes.

### Task 1: Tunnel into the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

In this task, you will gather the information you need about your Azure Kubernetes Service cluster to connect to the cluster and execute commands to connect to the Kubernetes management dashboard from cloud shell.

> **Note**: The following tasks should be executed in cloud shell and not the build machine, so disconnect from build machine if still connected

1. Verify that you are connected to the correct subscription with the following command to show your default subscription:

   ```bash
   az account show
   ```

   - If you are not connected to the correct subscription, list your subscriptions and then set the subscription by its id with the following commands (similar to what you did in cloud shell before the lab):

   ```bash
   az account list
   az account set --subscription {id}
   ```

2. Configure kubectl to connect to the Kubernetes cluster:

   ```bash
   az aks get-credentials --name fabmedical-SUFFIX --resource-group fabmedical-SUFFIX
   ```

3. Test that the configuration is correct by running a simple kubectl command to produce a list of nodes:

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console, kubectl get nodes has been typed and run at the command prompt, which produces a list of nodes.](media/image75.png)

4. Since the AKS cluster uses RBAC, a ClusterRoleBinding must be created before you can correctly access the dashboard. To create the required binding, execute the command bellow:

   ```bash
   kubectl create clusterrolebinding kubernetes-dashboard --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:kubernetes-dashboard
   ```

5. Create an SSH tunnel linking a local port (8001) on your cloud shell host to port 443 on the management node of the cluster. Cloud shell will then use the web preview feature to give you remote access to the Kubernetes dashboard. Execute the command below replacing the values as follows:

   > **Note**: After you run this command, it may work at first and later lose its connection, so you may have to run this again to reestablish the connection. If the Kubernetes dashboard becomes unresponsive in the browser this is an indication to return here and check your tunnel or rerun the command.

   ```bash
   az aks browse --name fabmedical-SUFFIX --resource-group fabmedical-SUFFIX
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console, the output of the above command produces output similar to the following: Password for private key: Proxy running on 127.0.0.1:8001/ui Press CTRL+C to close the tunnel ... Starting to server on 127.0.0.1:8001.](media/image76.png)

6. If the tunnel is successful, you will see the Kubernetes management dashboard.

   ![This is a screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard. Overview is highlighted on the left, and at right, kubernetes has a green check mark next to it. Below that, default-token-s6kmc is listed under Secrets.](media/image77.png)

   > **Note**: If the tunnel is not successful (if a JSON output is displayed), execute the command below and then return to task 5 above:
   >
   > ```bash
   > az extension add --name aks-preview
   > ```

### Task 2: Deploy a service using the Kubernetes management dashboard

In this task, you will deploy the API application to the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster using the Kubernetes dashboard.

1. From the Kubernetes dashboard, select Create in the top right corner.

2. From the Resource creation view, select Create an App.

   ![This is a screenshot of the Deploy a Containerized App dialog box. Specify app details below is selected, and the fields have been filled in with the information that follows. At the bottom of the dialog box is a SHOW ADVANCED OPTIONS link.](media/image78.png)

   - Enter "api" for the App name.

   - Enter [LOGINSERVER]/content-api for the Container Image, replacing [LOGINSERVER] with your ACR login server, such as fabmedicalsol.azurecr.io.

   - Set Number of pods to 1.

   - Set Service to "Internal".

   - Use 3001 for Port and 3001 for Target port.

3. Select **SHOW ADVANCED OPTIONS**

   - Enter 0.125 for the CPU requirement.

   - Enter 128 for the Memory requirement.

   ![In the Advanced options dialog box, the above information has been entered. At the bottom of the dialog box is a Deploy button.](media/image79.png)

4. Select Deploy to initiate the service deployment based on the image. This can take a few minutes. In the meantime, you will be redirected to the Overview dashboard. Select the API deployment from the Overview dashboard to see the deployment in progress.

   ![This is a screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard. Overview is highlighted on the left, and at right, a red arrow points to the api deployment.](media/image80.png)

5. Kubernetes indicates a problem with the api Replica Set after some seconds. Select the log icon to investigate.

   ![This screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard shows an error with the replica set.](media/Ex2-Task1.5.png)

6. The log indicates that the content-api application is once again failing because it cannot find a mongodb instance to communicate with. You will resolve this issue by migrating your data workload to Cosmos DB.

   ![This screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard shows logs output for the api container.](media/Ex2-Task1.6.png)

7. Open the Azure portal in your browser and navigate to your resource group and find your Cosmos DB resource. Select the Cosmos DB resource to view details.

   ![A screenshot of the Azure Portal showing the Cosmos DB among existing resources.](media/Ex2-Task1.9.png)

8. Under "Quick Start" select the "Node.js" tab and copy the Node 3.0 connection string.

   ![A screenshot of the Azure Portal showing the quick start for setting up Cosmos DB with MongoDB API.](media/Ex2-Task1.10.png)

9. Update the provided connection string with a database "contentdb" and a replica set "globaldb".

   > **Note**: Username and password redacted for brevity.

   ```text
   mongodb://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@fabmedical-<SUFFIX>.documents.azure.com:10255/contentdb?ssl=true&replicaSet=globaldb
   ```

10. To avoid disconnecting from the Kubernetes dashboard, open a **new** Azure Cloud Shell console.

    ![A screenshot of the cloud shell window with a red arrow pointing at the "Open new session" button on the toolbar](media/hol-2019-10-19_06-13-34.png)

11. You will setup a Kubernetes secret to store the connection string and configure the content-api application to access the secret. First, you must base64 encode the secret value. Open your Azure Cloud Shell window and use the following command to encode the connection string and then, copy the output.

    > **Note**: Double quote marks surrounding the connection string are required to successfully produce the required output.

    ```bash
    echo -n "[CONNECTION STRING VALUE]" | base64 -w 0 - | echo $(</dev/stdin)
    ```

    ![A screenshot of the Azure cloud shell window showing the command to create the base64 encoded secret.  The output to copy is highlighted.](media/hol-2019-10-18_07-12-13.png)

12. Return to the Kubernetes UI in your browser and select "+ Create". Update the following YAML with the encoded connection string from your clipboard, paste the YAML data into the create dialog, and choose "Upload".

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: mongodb
    type: Opaque
    data:
      db: <base64 encoded value>
    ```

    ![A screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing the YAML file for creating a deployment.](media/Ex2-Task1.13.png)

13. Scroll down in the Kubernetes dashboard until you can see "Secrets" in the left-hand menu. Select it.

    ![A screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing secrets.](media/Ex2-Task1.14.png)

14. View the details for the "mongodb" secret. Select the eyeball icon to show the secret.

    ![A screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing the value of a secret.](media/Ex2-Task1.15.png)

15. Next, download the api deployment configuration using the following command in your Azure Cloud Shell window:

    ```bash
    kubectl get -o=yaml --export=true deployment api > api.deployment.yml
    ```

16. Edit the downloaded file using cloud shell code editor:

    ```bash
    code api.deployment.yml
    ```

    Add the following environment configuration to the container spec, below the "image" property:

    ```yaml
      env:
        - name: MONGODB_CONNECTION
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mongodb
              key: db
    ```

    ![A screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing part of the deployment file.](media/Ex2-Task1.17.png)

17. Save your changes and close the editor.

    ![A screenshot of the code editor save and close actions.](media/Ex2-Task1.17.1.png)

18. Update the api deployment by using `kubectl` to apply the new configuration.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f api.deployment.yml
    ```

19. Select "Deployments" then "api" to view the api deployment. It now has a healthy instance and the logs indicate it has connected to mongodb.

    ![A screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing logs output.](media/Ex2-Task1.19.png)

### Task 3: Deploy a service using kubectl

In this task, deploy the web service using `kubectl`.

1. Open a **new** Azure Cloud Shell console.

2. Create a text file called web.deployment.yml using the Azure Cloud Shell
   Editor.

   ```bash
   code web.deployment.yml
   ```

3. Copy and paste the following text into the editor:

   > **Note**: Be sure to copy and paste only the contents of the code block carefully to avoid introducing any special characters.

           securityContext: {}
           terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
   ```

4. Update the [LOGINSERVER] entry to match the name of your ACR login server.

5. Select the **...** button and choose **Save**.

   ![In this screenshot of an Azure Cloud Shell editor window, the ... button has been selected and the Save option is highlighted.](media/b4-image62.png)

6. Select the **...** button again and choose **Close Editor**.

   ![In this screenshot of the Azure Cloud Shell editor window, the ... button has been selected and the Close Editor option is highlighted.](media/b4-image63.png)

7. Create a text file called web.service.yml using the Azure Cloud Shell
   Editor.

   ```bash
   code web.service.yml
   ```

8. Copy and paste the following text into the editor:

   > **Note**: Be sure to copy and paste only the contents of the code block carefully to avoid introducing any special characters.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     labels:
       app: web
     name: web
   spec:
     ports:
       - name: web-traffic
         port: 80
         protocol: TCP
         targetPort: 3000
     selector:
       app: web
     sessionAffinity: None
     type: LoadBalancer
   ```

9. Save changes and close the editor.

10. Type the following command to deploy the application described by the YAML
    files. You will receive a message indicating the items kubectl has created a
    web deployment and a web service.

    ```bash
    kubectl create --save-config=true -f web.deployment.yml -f web.service.yml
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of the console, kubectl apply -f kubernetes-web.yaml has been typed and run at the command prompt. Messages about web deployment and web service creation appear below.](media/image93.png)

11. Return to the browser where you have the Kubernetes management dashboard open. From the navigation menu, select Services view under Discovery and Load Balancing. From the Services view, select the web service, and from this view, you will see the web service deploying. This deployment can take a few minutes. When it completes, you should be able to access the website via an external endpoint.

    ![In the Kubernetes management dashboard, Services is selected below Discovery and Load Balancing in the navigation menu. At right are three boxes that display various information about the web service deployment: Details, Pods, and Events. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the window. Future versions of this course should address this.](media/image94.png)

12. Select the speakers and sessions links. Note that no data is displayed, although we have connected to our Cosmos DB instance, there is no data loaded. You will resolve this by running the content-init application as a Kubernetes Job in Task 5.

    ![A screenshot of the web site showing no data displayed.](media/Ex2-Task3.11.png)

### Task 4: Deploy a service using a Helm chart

In this task, deploy the web service using a helm chart.

1. From the Kubernetes dashboard, under "Workloads", select "Deployments".

2. Select the triple vertical dots on the right of the "web" deployment and then choose "Delete". When prompted, select "Delete" again.

   ![A screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing how to delete a deployment.](media/Ex2-Task4.2.png)

3. From the Kubernetes dashboard, under "Discovery and Load Balancing", select "Services".

   ![A screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing how to delete a deployment.](media/Ex2-Task4.4.png)

5. Open a **new** Azure Cloud Shell console.

6. Update your starter files by pulling the latest changes from Azure DevOps.

    ```bash
    cd ~/MCW-Cloud-native-applications/Hands-on\ lab/lab-files/developer/content-web
    git pull
    ```

7. We will use the `helm create` command to scaffold out a chart implementation that we can build on. Use the following commands to create a new chart named `web` in a new directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir charts
    cd charts
    helm create web
    ```

8. We now need to update the generated scaffold to match our requirements. We will first update the file named `values.yaml`.

    ```bash
    cd web
    code values.yaml
    ```

9. Search for the `image` definition and update the values so that they match the following:

    ```yaml
    image:
      repository: [LOGINSERVER].azurecr.io/content-web
      pullPolicy: Always
    ```

10. Search for `nameOverride` and `fullnameOverride` entries and update the values so that they match the following:

    ```yaml
    nameOverride: "web"
    fullnameOverride: "web"
    ```

11. Search for the `service` definition and update the values so that they match the following:

    ```yaml
    service:
      type: LoadBalancer
      port: 80
    ```

12. Search for the `resources` definition and update the values so that they match the following:

    ```yaml
    resources:
      # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
      # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
      # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
      # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
      # limits:
      #  cpu: 100m
      #  memory: 128Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 1000m
        memory: 128Mi
    ```

13. Save changes and close the editor.

14. We will now update the file named `Chart.yaml`.

    ```bash
    code Chart.yaml
    ```

15. Search for the `appVersion` entry and update the value so that it matches the following:

    ```yaml
    appVersion: latest
    ```

16. We will now update the file named `deployment.yaml`.

    ```bash
    cd templates
    code deployment.yaml
    ```

17. Search for the `metadata` definition and update the values so that they match the following:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      (...)
    spec:
      (...)
      template:
        metadata:
          (...)
          annotations:
            rollme: {{ randAlphaNum 5 | quote }}
    ```

18. Search for the `containers` definition and update the values so that they match the following:

    ```yaml
    containers:
      - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
        securityContext:
          {{- toYaml .Values.securityContext | nindent 12 }}
        image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Chart.AppVersion }}"
        imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.image.pullPolicy }}
        ports:
          - name: http
            containerPort: 3000
            protocol: TCP
        env:
          - name: CONTENT_API_URL
            value: http://api:3001
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: 3000
    ```

19. Save changes and close the editor.

20. We will now update the file named `service.yaml`.

    ```bash
    code service.yaml
    ```

21. Search for the `ports` definition and update the values so that they match the following:

    ```yaml
    ports:
      - port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
        targetPort: 3000
        protocol: TCP
        name: http
    ```

22. Save changes and close the editor.

23. The chart is now setup to run our web container. Type the following command to deploy the application described by the YAML files. You will receive a message indicating that helm has created a web deployment and a web service.

    ```bash
    cd ../..
    helm install web ./web
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of the console, helm install web ./web has been typed and run at the command prompt. Messages about web deployment and web service creation appear below.](media/Ex2-Task4.24.png)

24. Return to the browser where you have the Kubernetes management dashboard open. From the navigation menu, select Services view under Discovery and Load Balancing. From the Services view, select the web service, and from this view, you will see the web service deploying. This deployment can take a few minutes. When it completes, you should be able to access the website via an external endpoint.

    ![In the Kubernetes management dashboard, Services is selected below Discovery and Load Balancing in the navigation menu. At right are three boxes that display various information about the web service deployment: Details, Pods, and Events. "External endpoints" is highlighted to show that an external endpoint has been created.](media/image94.png)

25. Select the speakers and sessions links. Note that no data is displayed, although we have connected to our Cosmos DB instance, there is no data loaded. You will resolve this by running the content-init application as a Kubernetes Job.

    ![A screenshot of the web site showing no data displayed.](media/Ex2-Task3.11.png)

26. We will now persist the changes into the repository. Execute the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    git pull
    git add charts/
    git commit -m "Helm chart added."
    git push
    ```

### Task 5: Initialize database with a Kubernetes Job

In this task, you will use a Kubernetes Job to run a container that is meant to execute a task and terminate, rather than run all the time.

1. Create a text file called init.job.yml using the Azure Cloud Shell Editor.

   ```bash
   code init.job.yml
   ```

2. Copy and paste the following text into the editor:

   > **Note**: Be sure to copy and paste only the contents of the code block carefully to avoid introducing any special characters.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: batch/v1
   kind: Job
   metadata:
     name: init
   spec:
     template:
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: init
           image: [LOGINSERVER]/content-init
           env:
             - name: MONGODB_CONNECTION
               valueFrom:
                 secretKeyRef:
                   name: mongodb
                   key: db
         restartPolicy: Never
     backoffLimit: 4
   ```

3. Edit this file and update the [LOGINSERVER] entry to match the name of your ACR login server.

4. Save changes and close the editor.

5. Type the following command to deploy the job described by the YAML. You will receive a message indicating the kubectl has created an init "job.batch".

   ```bash
   kubectl create --save-config=true -f init.job.yml
   ```

6. View the Job by selecting "Jobs" under "Workloads" in the Kubernetes UI.

   ![A screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing jobs.](media/Ex2-Task5.6.png)

7. Select the log icon to view the logs.

   ![A screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing log output.](media/Ex2-Task5.7.png)

8. Next view your Cosmos DB instance in the Azure portal and see that it now contains two collections.

   ![A screenshot of the Azure Portal showing Cosmos DB collections.](media/Ex2-Task5.8.png)

### Task 6: Test the application in a browser

In this task, you will verify that you can browse to the web service you have deployed and view the speaker and content information exposed by the API service.

1. From the Kubernetes management dashboard, in the navigation menu, select the Services view under Discovery and Load Balancing.

2. In the list of services, locate the external endpoint for the web service and select this hyperlink to launch the application.

   ![In the Services box, a red arrow points at the hyperlinked external endpoint for the web service.](media/image112.png)

3. You will see the web application in your browser and be able to select the Speakers and Sessions links to view those pages without errors. The lack of errors means that the web application is correctly calling the API service to show the details on each of those pages.

   ![In this screenshot of the Contoso Neuro 2017 web application, Speakers has been selected, and sample speaker information appears at the bottom.](media/image114.png)

   ![In this screenshot of the Contoso Neuro 2017 web application, Sessions has been selected, and sample session information appears at the bottom.](media/image115.png)

### Task 7: Configure Continuous Delivery to the Kubernetes Cluster

In this task, you will use Azure DevOps to automate the process for deploying the web image to the AKS cluster. You will update the DevOps Pipeline and configure a deployment stage so that when new images are pushed to the ACR, the pipeline deploys the image to the AKS cluster.

1. Login to your Azure DevOps account, access the `fabmedical` project you created earlier, then select "Pipelines".

2. From the pipelines list, select the `content-web` pipeline and select `Edit.`

   ![A screenshot with the `content-web` pipeline selected and the `Edit` button highlighted.](media/hol-2019-10-02_10-06-57.png)

3. You will add a second job to the `Build and Push` stage, below the existing `Docker` job. Paste the following into the pipeline editor:

   > **Note**: Be careful to check your indenting when pasting. The `job` node should be indented with 2 spaces and line up with the `job` node for the `Docker` job.

   ```yaml
   - job: Helm
    displayName: Build and Push Helm Chart
    pool:
      vmImage: $(vmImageName)
    steps:
      - checkout: self
        fetchDepth: 1

      - task: HelmInstaller@1
        inputs:
          helmVersionToInstall: 'latest'
        displayName: 'Helm Install'

      - task: HelmDeploy@0
        inputs:
          connectionType: 'None'
          command: 'package'
          chartPath: 'charts/web'
          chartVersion: '$(Build.BuildNumber)'
          save: false
        displayName: 'Helm Package'

      - task: AzureCLI@1

5. Now return to the pipeline editor to create a deployment stage. Paste the following into the pipeline editor and update the SUFFIX values:

   > **Note**: Be careful to check your indenting when pasting. The `stage` node should be indented with 0 spaces and line up with the `stage` node for the `Build` stage.

   ```yaml
   - stage:
     displayName: AKS Deployment
     jobs:
       - deployment: DeployAKS
         displayName: "Deployment to AKS"
         pool:
           vmImage: $(vmImageName)
         environment: "aks"
         strategy:
           runOnce:
             deploy:

                   displayName: "Helm Install"

                 - task: AzureCLI@1
                   inputs:
                     azureSubscription: "azurecloud"

                       set -euo pipefail

                       az acr helm repo add --name $(containerRegistryName)

                     failOnStandardError: true
                   displayName: "Helm repo update"

                 - task: HelmDeploy@0

                     command: "upgrade"
                     chartType: "Name"
                     chartName: "$(containerRegistryName)/web"
                     releaseName: "web"

6. Select "Save" and commit the changes directly to the master branch. A new build will start automatically. The two jobs are independent and will run in parallel if there are enough available build agents. However, the deployment depends on the jobs and will wait for them to complete before starting.

### Task 8: Review Azure Monitor for Containers

In this task, you will access and review the various logs and dashboards made available by Azure Monitor for Containers.

1. From the Azure Portal, select the resource group you created named fabmedical-SUFFIX, and then select your AKS cluster.

   ![In this screenshot, the resource group was previously selected and the AKS cluster is selected.](media/Ex2-Task8.1.png)

2. From the Monitoring blade, select **Insights**.

   ![In the Monitoring blade, Insights is highlighted.](media/Ex2-Task8.2.png)

3. Review the various available dashboards and a deeper look at the various metrics and logs available on the Cluster, Cluster Nodes, Cluster Controllers, and deployed Containers.

   ![In this screenshot, the dashboards and blades are shown.](media/Ex2-Task8.3.png)

4. To review the Containers dashboards and see more detailed information about each container, select the containers tab.

   ![In this screenshot, the various containers information is shown.](media/monitor_1.png)

5. Now filter by container name and search for the web containers, you will see all the containers created in the Kubernetes cluster with the pod names. You can compare the names with those in the kubernetes dashboard.

   ![In this screenshot, the containers are filtered by container named web.](media/monitor_3.png)

6. By default, the CPU Usage metric will be selected displaying all cpu information for the selected container, to switch to another metric open the metric dropdown list and select a different metric.

   ![In this screenshot, the various metric options are shown.](media/monitor_2.png)

7. Upon selecting any pod, all the information related to the selected metric will be displayed on the right panel, and that would be the case when selecting any other metric, the details will be displayed on the right panel for the selected pod.
